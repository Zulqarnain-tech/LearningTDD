# LearningTDD

## Introduction
In this learning project, am exploring the test driven development approach.
I am creating a small scale app that tells me about the movies i have watched and the movies to be watched.
I am learning about the red, green and then the refactor phases of TDD.

## What is TDD?
A practice that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code for a feature or functionality. TDD follows a cycle of writing tests, writing code to make those tests pass, and then refactoring the code as needed.
